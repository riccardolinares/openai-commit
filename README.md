# OpenAI Commit Github Action
This Github Action allows you to easily integrate OpenAI API into your workflow. With just a few steps, you can use OpenAI's language model to generate responses for your project.


## Usage
In your Github Actions workflow, add the following YAML code to utilize the action:

```
- name: OpenAI
  uses: riccardolinares/openai-commit@main
  with:
    openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
    openai-prompt: <your-prompt>
    model: <model-id>
  id: openai
```

## Inputs
The action requires the following inputs:

- `openai-api-key`: Your OpenAI API key. This should be stored as a secret in your Github repository.
- `openai-prompt`: The text prompt to be passed to the OpenAI API.
- `model`: The ID of the OpenAI model to be used. (optional, default is text-davinci-003)

## Outputs
The output of the action is a response generated by OpenAI API. You can access the response by logging the output of the action.
```
${{ steps.openai.outputs.text}}
```
